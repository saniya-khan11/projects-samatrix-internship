## 📌 1. Portfolio Risk Assessment & 1-Day 95% Value at Risk (VaR) Estimation

### 🔹 Description
Analyzed historical stock data and estimated 1-Day 95% VaR using multiple statistical methods.

### 🔹 Key Work
- Used Python, Pandas, yFinance, and SciPy to compute daily log returns.
- Estimated VaR using:
  - Normal Distribution  
  - Student’s t-distribution  
  - Historical Simulation  
- Applied financial data analysis, statistical modeling, and created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📌 2. Website A/B Testing for Conversion Optimization

### 🔹 Description
Simulated e-commerce user funnels to evaluate conversion improvements through statistical A/B testing.

### 🔹 Key Work
- Simulated checkout funnels and compared conversion rates between variants.
- Conducted statistical analysis using:
  - Z-tests  
  - Confidence intervals  
  - Real-time p-value and lift calculations  
- Used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Statsmodels for data simulation and visualization.

## 📌 3. Call Center Operations Optimization: A Simulation-Based Approach

### 🔹 Description
Developed simulation models to optimize call center performance and staffing efficiency.

### 🔹 Key Work
- Built M/M/1 and M/M/s queueing simulations.
- Modeled Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and customer abandonment.
- Evaluated performance metrics:
  - Wait times  
  - Queue lengths  
- Performed cost-based optimization to determine ideal staffing levels.
